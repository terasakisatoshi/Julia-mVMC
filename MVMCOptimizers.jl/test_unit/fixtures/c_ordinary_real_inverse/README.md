# Ordinary real direct inverse, private MVMC route (#184/#176)

Base PR54 bd7f3da33d5a785ffdb646ed32eed9369a679a41. No dependency gitlink,
complex/FSZ factor/inverse, new FFI, method piracy or RNG change.
The private helper retains existing TRTRI, upper copy, negated vT, column
permutation, BLAS TRMM and row permutation; only real scalar solver uses
the four numerator/denominator branches from unchanged invert.tcc.

Real4 input/output/operator are static copies of independently acquired
native C fixtures, NOT Rust/Julia-generated replacements. Original acquisition
README and real-direct-probe README are retained verbatim, with historical
absolute paths/scopes intact. Normal tests do not invoke C or read the Rust
repository/toolbox. Native C real4 max difference0 vs historical Julia; condition
estimate14.2, residual2.7755575615628914e-16, backward error1.826024711554534e-17.
Existing256eps abs+rel plus scaled residual is unchanged; it is not a generic
ill-conditioned matrix or SR/runner parameter tolerance.

Analytic dyadic4 tridiagonal system exercises all four solve branches. Public
2x2 finite divisors2^1023 and2^-1023 have off-diagonal +/- reciprocal and zero
diagonals. Internal smallest-subnormal/Inf/zero classifications are diagnostics,
not accepted finite public models or provider-independent NaN TRMM assertions.

Internal smallest-subnormal zero numerator gave NaN, equal numerator gave Inf.

No native first-walker/full SR/trajectory adoption or tolerance waiver is inferred.

This helper deliberately retains the existing FULL TRMM pipeline. C invert.tcc
also has an ILAENV-selected !full panel/trmmt branch with skew reconstruction;
that branch is not newly ported or universally covered by this local patch.
Nonidentity pivot regression is a separate independent analytic4 control:
tridiagonal upper entries2,1,4, axes permutation[3,2,1,4], observed factor
pivots[1,2,1,4] (genuine net swap). The literal dyadic inverse is checked by
S*X=I and the ordinary child's row-major storage. All arithmetic is exactly
representable; no N6 forward budget or new tolerance follows. Existing native
N6 first-walker diagnostics are separate evidence, not imported golden values.
