# Fixed-value C var formatting reference

Generated separately on Linux x86_64 with GCC13.3.0,
`cc -std=c11 -O0`, from mVMC1.3.0 `vmcmain.c:655–657`'s literal
fprintf templates and full `for(i=0;i<NPara;i++)` loop. No sampling, BLAS,
computed floating-point normalization or Julia/Rust oracle is involved.
The test only reads the checked-in bytes; it does not compile/invoke C.

Input: Etot=-3+0im, Etot2=9+0im, NPara33. Slots are Gutz2, Jast2,
DH2 six, DH4 ten, nine RBM slots, Slater2, OptTrans2. Zero-based slots
1 and 3 are zero; all others hold `(i+1)/8 - (i+1)/16*im`.
These are binary-exact constants. Each complex value has a literal third
field `0.0`, followed by a space; the whole row ends with one newline.
This is a writer fixture, not a full accepted-input/trajectory reference.
