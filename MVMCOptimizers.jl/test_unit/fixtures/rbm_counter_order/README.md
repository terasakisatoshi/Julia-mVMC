`probe.c` contains the verbatim function plus minimal parameter/mapping inputs;
its upstream GPL notice is preserved. It is an optional standalone kernel
probe, not a C executable/MPI/sampling-trajectory validation.

For each Charge/Spin/General hidden neuron, C starts the coupling sum at zero,
then adds that sum to the already initialized hidden bias once. Julia previously
added each coupling directly to the bias. Bias `1+2i` and coupling terms
`+(2^54+2^55 i)` and `-(2^54+2^55 i)` distinguish these operations exactly:
the C result is the bias, whereas the old Julia result is zero. Real-only cases
use zero imaginary parts. Every mapping is complete for the two-site input;
General uses spin-major order and zero-valued down-spin couplings.

Reproduce the optional probe from the fork root:

```sh
cc -std=c11 -O0 -ffp-contract=off \
  MVMCOptimizers.jl/test_unit/fixtures/rbm_counter_order/probe.c \
  -o /tmp/rbm-counter-order-probe
/tmp/rbm-counter-order-probe
```

Verified on Linux x86_64 with Ubuntu GCC 13.3.0: all six cases return `1+0i`
or `1+2i`. Normal Julia tests use immutable analytical expectations only;
they do not compile or invoke this probe. No floating-point tolerance is used.
This patch preserves existing term traversal and incremental hopping updates;
it changes only full-counter bias/coupling grouping. It does not by itself
establish full-model sampling parity or justify any numerical-budget change.
