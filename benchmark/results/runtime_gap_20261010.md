# Remaining Rust–Julia runtime gap, 2026-10-10

Related to upstream issue #73.

Baseline: upstream `7b1ffd519e24f1794807ad326e09ee49a6a8cd3f`, which includes PR #72.
Candidate: the source hashes and diff in `runtime_gap_20261010_environment.json` identify the exact measured code.
Linux x86_64 Dev Container, AMD Ryzen 9 PRO 8945HS (8 cores / 16 logical CPUs), Julia 1.13.1,
Rust 1.99.0, MPICH 4.2.0 `/opt/mpich` (`ch4:ucx`, Hydra / PMI1).
Rust and Julia's native helper use OpenBLAS 0.3.26 LP64; Julia LinearAlgebra uses OpenBLAS 0.3.30 ILP64.
All BLAS pools are verified at one thread per process; native helper and Julia BLAS are checked independently.
GC threads: one. Julia default/interactive pools: `4,0`, `2,0`, `1,0`.

300 SR steps, 300 total samples per step (300 / 150 / 75 per process), one full warmup, three repetitions.
Median of the slowest process's warmed production API time, including production parsing/output but excluding launch,
JIT and warmup. Baseline and candidate phases ran sequentially with no concurrent heavy builds/tests.
Rust was remeasured in both phases; no historical baseline is substituted. Three repetitions are descriptive, not a confidence interval.
Julia executed MVMC frames on 4 / 2 / 1 threads, including the driver. Rust's default gates selected serial inner kernels
on these small inputs (observed pooled workers 0); a configured pool size is not evidence of kernel parallel execution.
Processes use different chain seeds and trajectories. These data compare throughput, not effective samples or convergence.

| Model | Processes × threads | Julia before (s) | Julia after (s) | Reduction | Rust before / after (s) | Julia after / Rust after |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| L16 | 1 × 4 | 4.991915 | 4.286273 | 14.1% | 3.112387 / 3.103700 | 1.381 |
| L16 | 2 × 2 | 2.911010 | 2.335425 | 19.8% | 1.720491 / 1.680704 | 1.390 |
| L16 | 4 × 1 | 1.712879 | 1.151904 | 32.8% | 0.976469 / 0.969523 | 1.188 |
| L24 | 1 × 4 | 9.311548 | 8.107485 | 12.9% | 6.422753 / 6.436101 | 1.260 |

Julia elapsed time fell by 12.9–32.8% across these nine cases.
The remaining Julia/Rust ratio is 1.108–1.390; this patch does not establish equal speed.

## Where the remaining time goes

The following is a separate warmed, instrumented L32 one-process/one-thread run, **not** the headline medians.
Timers are nested and must not be added; profiling and timer probes have overhead. Cross-language phase comparisons
are diagnostic because floating-point acceptance differences can change trajectories.

| Instrumented L32, 1 process × 1 thread | Julia before (s) | Julia after (s) | Rust (s) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Total | 16.39686 | 13.72662 | 12.77368 |
| Sampling | 4.70703 | 3.91240 | 4.22677 |
| Main calculation | 10.28693 | 9.33564 | 8.16783 |
| Per-sample Pfaffian / inverse | 8.24760 | 7.40312 | 6.14992 |
| Slater update | 0.68751 | 0.16489 | 0.04928 |
| SR total | 0.54086 | 0.14498 | 0.05967 |
| SR postprocess | 0.41094 | 0.01430 | 0.00023 |
| DPOSV | 0.04194 | 0.04034 | 0.04397 |

Baseline per-sample Pfaffian/inverse work was 8.24760 / 16.39686 s (50.3% of total),
and it remains the largest kernel target. CPU samples identified factorization/inverse scalar loops and array access.
GC alone does not explain the gap: baseline GC was 0.376 s.
The same final timer probe allocated 5,529,366,920 bytes before and
539,275,144 bytes after (90.2% less).
These are cumulative allocations in a production call, including parsing/output, not resident memory.

## Implemented changes and evidence

* Resolve `qp_weights::Any` once to `QuantumProjectionWeights` before the Slater site-pair loops.
  A 0.1% allocation sample on the **intermediate** candidate identified boxed `ComplexF64` arithmetic here;
  the allocation-site file is diagnostic sampled bytes, not an extrapolated exact total.
* Read live projection coefficients in flattened C layout without building a new parameter vector for every proposal;
  preserve missing header slots, coefficient updates and the scalar accumulation order.
* Reuse two rank-local serial hop-update vectors in `SamplingWorkspace`; poisoned-buffer tests check overwrite and tails.
* Batch direct-SR parameter changes into one layout/duplicate scan; preserve sequential real/imaginary additions,
  last-wins duplicate lookup, untouched fixed duplicates, retained slots and QPOptTrans weight refresh.
* Check dimensions/indexing once before bounds-check-free ordinary real factor/inverse loops; SIMD only across
  independent rank-2 update elements. No `@fastmath`, fused `muladd`, solver replacement or RNG changes.

A four-column blocked tridiagonal solve inspired by Rust was tested on fixed input and rejected:
at n=32 the existing Julia solve took about 0.900 µs, the blocked trial 1.240 µs.
The committed solver keeps its original loop and arithmetic order. Adjacent child-kernel records compare fixed n=16/24/32
skew operators with preallocated workspaces (three batches of 10,000 calls); they are not whole-workload timings.

Next priorities are the per-sample matrix assembly/factorization/inverse pipeline: isolate each stage on identical matrices,
measure strided `SubArray` access and redundant scratch copies/initialization, and consider contiguous specialized kernels
only with independent residuals and unchanged arithmetic/RNG contracts. Whole-pipeline replacement, reciprocal division,
BLAS provider changes and additional thread spawning are not validated shortcuts in this report.

## Correctness and reproducibility

Full MVMCOptimizers suite on the final source: 22,158 assertions passed with one thread, 22,159 with four threads.
Focused coverage includes projection slots/live values/zero allocations, poisoned reusable buffers, SR duplicate and
repeated-component semantics, invalid dimensions, strided views, independent `T \ B` results and residuals (256 eps).
The exchange-counter provenance guard now hashes the two independently extracted upstream sampler bodies rather than
unrelated helpers in the whole file; both sampler bodies and all acceptance expectations remain unchanged.

All nine 20-step model/layout prefixes: 42 initial/final SFMT 624-word blocks matched exactly;
88,794 finite computed fields compared with abs=rel=1e-11 (maximum observed absolute difference 0).
This preserves the previous numerical tolerance; computed results are not compared bitwise.
An additional isolated audit forwards the original C RNG primitives and hashes integer words plus primitive kind and seed:
21 rank/model streams, 6,550,581 `gen_rand32` calls and
2,016 `genrand_real2` calls matched exactly in count and order. This runtime instrumentation is excluded from timings.
The real2 conversion is checked against C `to_real2` for its consumed word. No SFMT library/source changes.
Local verification is Linux x86_64 Julia 1.13.1; CI coverage is reported in the pull request, not assumed here.

Raw Julia CSVs, complete phase environment/hashes/diffs, executed drivers, timer/allocation records and parity summary
are adjacent to this report. The Rust checkout was dirty at measurement: its HEAD alone is not the executed source identifier.
Tracked input/lock provenance starts at Rust repository commit `72ca4e99e6b5c0e24b653a1b6176dea7c9540d48`;
the isolated resolved Manifest, preferences and prepared-input hashes are retained in metadata.
The original Julia submodule pin remains at upstream baseline until this new PR is reviewed and merged.
